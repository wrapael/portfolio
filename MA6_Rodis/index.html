            <h3>Quick Breakdown</h3>
            <p>The origin of Arnis Martial arts is from the Philippines. It is also known to some parts of the country
                as Eskrima and Kali. The objectives of Arnis focus mainly on defending oneself through the use of hand
                to hand combat, grappling, disarming of weapons, and striking with sticks. Arnis has evolved into more
                than a hundred variations, developed by different islands and families, and one reason for this number
                of variations is that the Philippines is an archipelago.<br>
                However, all the said styles or variations use a machete, knife, sticks, and empty hand styles such as
                Filipino boxing and wrestling. The primary weapon used in Arnis is a baton. It is 28 inches in length
                and can be used as a single weapon or a dual weapon. The stick or baton is considered sacred by Arnis
                practitioners and is always treated with the utmost care.</p>

            <h3>History of Arnis</h3>
            <p>To understand how the art had evolved, it would be better to know at least a short history of Arnis.
                Arnis is a native fighting technique that has continuously evolved over time. This is the fighting art
                that the Filipinos used when Magellan first stepped foot onto the shores of Mactan, Cebu. During the
                period that Spain colonized the Philippines, old fencing techniques from Spain influenced the art.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>However, during that time, practicing or teaching Arnis was illegal because it is considered a dangerous
                martial art. Its lethal nature is also what makes it one of the best martial arts to learn for
                self-defense. Locals would disguise it as a dance so that it would be possible to pass down the fighting
                art to the next generation. The modern Arnis training program that is widely practiced today, on the
                other hand, was developed by Remy Presas. <br><br>
                This modern fighting system aims to preserve the older Arnis techniques and make them even more
                effective by utilizing the moves in a manner that immediately hits the attackerâ€™s vital points. The
                modern system emphasizes foot stances, hand movements, and vital points that help finish the fight
                faster.</p>
